# tree-map
  Our City Forest's Tree Map is developed in Ionic 3 and provides information about the tree population in San Jos√©, California.

# Goals
- Provide tree census of Santa Clara County
- Report financial and environmental benefits via i-Tree STREETS and i-Tree ECO, respectively
- Stewards, OCF (Our City Forest) staff, and local volunteers can take a picture and overlay an image with strokes that highlight which branch(es) to cut down
- Add mobile notifications for tree stewards
  - tree water maintenance
  - pruning
- Display list of those who fund events such as community plantings ranked by:
  - amount invested in US dollars
  - quantity of trees purchased/planted
  - number of volunteer hours

# Dependencies for local development

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [Ionic 3](http://ionicframework.com/getting-started/)
- [Google Maps Javascript API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/tutorial) (API Key already provided)

# Build for local development
1. Git clone this repository
2. From within the cloned repository folder:
    1. Install node packages
    2. Compile the app and serve it on local computer

Ionic should open a new tab in a default browser at this point. The app can also be entered from `www/index.html`, a file which is available after step 2.ii -- below are the commands to get up and running in a local repo.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/justinhester/tree-map.git
$ cd tree-map
$ npm install
$ ionic serve
```
